# TaskVault Web Share Debug Version

## Focus: Fix Web Share (No Notifications)

This version removes notifications entirely and focuses on debugging web share functionality.

### Key Features Added:

1. **Debug Button**: Click "Debug" in top-right to see web share info
2. **Console Logging**: Extensive logging of web share parameters
3. **Visual Feedback**: Shows if web share worked or failed
4. **Enhanced Manifest**: Proper share_target configuration

### How to Debug Web Share:

1. Upload files to GitHub Pages
2. Install as PWA (Add to Home Screen) on mobile
3. Go to Twitter/YouTube and share any link
4. Select TaskVault from share menu
5. Look for:
   - Green success message if task was created
   - Yellow warning if no URL detected
   - Debug info in top-right corner
   - Console logs in browser dev tools

### Web Share Requirements:

- Must be installed as PWA
- Must be accessed via HTTPS (GitHub Pages provides this)
- Browser must support Web Share Target API
- Manifest must be properly configured

### If Web Share Still Doesn't Work:

Check the debug info to see exactly what parameters are being received. This will help identify if:
- No parameters are coming through (browser/OS issue)
- Wrong parameter names (manifest configuration issue)
- URL not being parsed correctly (parsing logic issue)

The debug version provides all the information needed to identify the specific issue.
